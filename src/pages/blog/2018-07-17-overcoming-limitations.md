# Overcoming limitations!

It took me about 7 months to do the crow pose (first part) and I recently overcame the fear of placing my head on the ground. Now I’m working on finding the right position on the ground to improve it further.



Life is a series of constant readjustments and trials and a continued battle against one’s fears.



Face whatever it is that is holding you back today from becoming who you want to be!



Nothing is impossible 🤸🏻‍♀️🙏🏻
